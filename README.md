"# ApexDocker" 

// GitHub Repository containing the Test Code for the Apex Live Broadcast Application

// This code is intended to read in packets sent by the Apex Beacons, perform minimal processing, then Aggregate the Packet Streams to 
// remove Duplicate and Out of Sequence Packets. 

// All code is written in Go

// To Build a new version of the .exe run the Go Build 'version.go' command in the Apex Docker folder to compile the file.
// nb. This requires that Go has already been installed on the computer
